# SnapHunt
A location-based photo scavenger hunt game. 

Players start by looking for "hunts" in their current location on the map. Once they have selected a hunt, he/she must select one of the keywords of that particular hunt and take a picture to match the keyword, once all keywords has been matched the hunt is completed and added to the player's completed hunts.

Hunts are created by other players, looking at their surrounding and taking note of what they see, these becomes the keywords  that other players needs to match. Each hunt is tagged by it's location and will only show up on the map for players that are within the area.

### Clarifai AI
